=======================
collective.patchwatcher
=======================

A great companion for keeping track of patched or overridden files.

It requires you to have installed the programs diff and diff3.

Features
--------

- provide an easy way to declare your overriden files for your package (including version of the dependencies)
- automatically check the declarations of a package for version updates of the dependencies
- automatically merge version updates into your overrides
- additionally use your declarations to add version pins for the dependencies in the setup.py of your package


Examples
--------

Assume you have overridden a file called "querywidget.pt" with jbot in your own package called "my.package" in a folder called "overrides" (the default way to do this).
The file is orginally provided by archetypes.querywidget and lives in the Folder "skins/querywidget/" of that package. When you created the override, archetypes.querywidget version 1.1.2 was installed.
To make this explicit, you have to create a file called "overrides_info.py" inside your package namespace which has to offer an importable variable "declarations".

It should contain the following content:

```
from collective.patchwatcher import DeclarationCollection

declarations = DeclarationCollection()

declarations.add(
    package="archetypes.querywidget",
    version="1.1.2",
    path="./skins/querywidget/querywidget.pt",
    local_path="./overrides/archetypes.querywidget.skins.querywidget.querywidget.pt",
)
# add more declarations as you wish
```

The declaration states the original package, version and relative file path as well as the local path to your override.

Now you can call the patchwatcher script to check your declarations for your package
after you potentially updated its dependency packages (e.g. by updating your Plone version):

./bin/patchwatcher -e "/home/username/zinstance/eggs" -p my.package

Patchwatcher needs the path to your eggs directory to find the latest version (in our example version 1.1.4) of
archetypes.querywidget. It will look for changes between both orginal files in versions 1.1.2 and 1.1.4.
If it finds changes, it will try to apply the changes to your overridden file using a three-way-merge.

Add the "-w" option to the script invocation if you want to save the result of the three-way merge.
The result will then be written back into the override file. There may be conflicts, which then have to be resolved manually.
After the merge operation, you will have to update your declaration to 1.1.4 in the "overrides_info.py" file.

Documentation
-------------

Full documentation for end users can be found in the "docs" folder, and is also available online at http://docs.plone.org/foo/bar

Installation
------------

Install collective.patchwatcher by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    ...

    parts +=
        patchwatcher

    [patchwatcher]
    eggs =
        collective.patchwatcher
        ${instance:eggs}
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    initialization =
            import sys
            sys.argv[1:1] = "-e ${buildout:eggs-directory}".split()
    scripts = patchwatcher


and then running ``bin/buildout``. After that the script ``bin/patchwatcher`` is conveniently pre-configured with the buildout's eggs path.

TODO
--------

- Allow multiple eggs folders (e.g. from installations of different plone major versions) making -e an extension to the default
- Add a more comfortable way to include z3c.jbot overrides (.e.g. putting multiple override container paths into DeclarationList)
- Adjust the final statement per package (use -w if there were changes) to accomodate for the existence of changes (would need to track the changes though)
- Add a convenience parameter that creates a declarations output of suggested declarations (could be depending on override container paths)
